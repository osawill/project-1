For checkpoint 1, we primarily used `telnet` to test the functionality of our simple echo server with multiple
concurrent clients.

For the remainder of the assignment, when implementing HEAD, GET, and POST requests, we mainly used `curl` to test
the accuracy of our server's responses.

Using `curl`, we did requests such as:
`curl -i localhost:9034/test.txt`
and
`curl -I localhost:9034/test.txt`
to ensure an accurate GET response on a file that actually exists,
as well as similar requests on file's that did not exist in order to check the validity of our server's
appropriate use for 404 responses.
